      "Given the sequence: 25, 75, 50, ..., where each term represents the cost of a different item in cents, and the sequence starts with a candy bar, followed by two pieces of chocolate, and ends with a pack of juice. If the average cost of the three items before the pack of juice is ¢50, what is the cost of the pack of juice?\n",
      "Let's denote the cost of the pack of juice as x. The total cost of the three items before the pack of juice is 25+75+50 = <<25+75+50=150>>150 cents. The average cost of these three items is 150/3 = <<150/3=50>>50 cents. Since the average cost of the three items is 50 cents, the cost of the pack of juice is x = 50 - (25+75) = <<50-(25+75)=-100>>-100 cents. However, since the cost cannot be negative, we need to add the appropriate multiple of 100 cents to make it positive. The smallest multiple of 100 cents that makes the cost positive is 100 cents. So the cost of the pack of juice is x = -100 + 100 = <<-100+100=0>>0 cents. However, since the cost cannot be zero, we need to add another multiple of 100 cents to make it positive again.
