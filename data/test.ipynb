      "{'instruction': \"Research Einstein's theory of relativity and provide a brief explanation.\", 'response': \"Einstein's theory of relativity refers to two theories: general relativity and special relativity. \\n\\nSpecial relativity, published in 1905, describes the physical laws that govern the motion of objects moving at a constant speed in a straight line, close to or at the speed of light. It is based on the idea that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, and that the speed of light is constant for all observers, regardless of the relative motion of the source. This theory introduced new concepts such as the famous mass-energy equivalence formula, E = mc².\\n\\nGeneral relativity, published in 1915, expanded on special relativity by including gravity and acceleration. It describes gravity not as a force between masses, but as the curvature of space and time caused by mass and energy. According to this theory, massive objects cause a distortion in space-time, and other objects, including light, follow curved paths in the presence of this distortion.\\n\\nEinstein's theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity, and has had many successful experimental confirmations, including the bending of light by the sun, the mercury's orbit, and the detection of gravitational waves. It is seen as one of the two pillars of modern physics, alongside quantum mechanics.\", 'ifd_score': 0.9453125}\n"
